			<p>Although conventional supermarkets are usually more convenient than your local farmer’s market, more markets have appeared throughout Nassau and Suffolk counties on Long Island. When researching the benefits of farmer’s markets over conventional supermarkets, the health benefits are evident. Farmer’s markets provide the community with fresher, healthier and more nutritious food.</p><br>

			<p>My intent for choosing this topic is to show the importance of local markets and how they effect consumers, farmers, and the community as a whole. I often reflect on my own personal experience of studying abroad in Florence, Italy; my apartment sat immediately adjacent to a local farm stand. The convenience was favorable as I was buying fresh local produce for cooking with relative ease. The city's largest market, Mercado Central, contained numerous merchants with various produce. The vendors carried different fruits, assorted veggies, fresh meats, aged cheeses, organic eggs, exotic spices and much, much more. While vacationing in Montauk I experienced my first Long Island market. This Farmer’s Market located in the heart of town was my favorite. In addition to the produce it contained local artists, home-brewed beverages, and even freshly squeezed lemonade; a true representation of the local community. My goal is to shed light on the benefits of supporting your community by buying locally.</p><br>

			<p>In gathering research needed to prove the advantage of farmers market’s, I contacted those who would know best, farmers. My conversations began with Phil Schmitt of Riverhead, and Paulette Satur of Cutchogue who disclosed their extensive histories in the farming industry. Other people I spoke with are market coordinators Lona Graepel <a href="http://www.longislandfarmersmarkets.com/">(G&G LI Winter Markets)</a>, Greg Sandor (<a href="http://ccesuffolk.org/">Cornell University Cooperative)</a> and Natasha Beccaria <a href="http://www.lifb.com/">(LI Farm Bureau)</a>. Each discussed why they are so passionate about farmer’s markets. To expand my knowledge I traveled across Long Island to see what each market had to offer.</p>
